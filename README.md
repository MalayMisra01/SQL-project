For my project, I developed a Library Management System using SQL. The goal of the system is to manage library operations such as tracking books, members, and transactions like book issuance and returns. Through this project, I applied key SQL concepts including database design, normalization, and query writing to create a functional database model.

I began by designing the database schema, which consists of three primary tables: Members, Books, and Transactions. Each table was designed to store specific information, with relationships established between them using foreign keys. The Members table stores data about library members, while the Books table holds information about the available books. The Transactions table tracks book issues and returns, linking members and books with transaction records. This relational model ensured the database was well-structured and supported data integrity.

I implemented several SQL queries to manipulate and retrieve data. For instance, I wrote queries to list all currently issued books, count how many books each member has borrowed, and determine the most issued books over time. These queries required the use of joins, aggregate functions, and grouping, all of which are vital skills for handling real-world data in relational databases.

Furthermore, I applied normalization to reduce redundancy and ensure that the database structure is optimized for both storage and performance. By organizing the data efficiently, I was able to maintain accurate and easily accessible records of transactions, ensuring smooth library management.

This project enhanced my ability to design and implement SQL-based systems, improve data retrieval efficiency, and develop real-world database solutions for business problems.
